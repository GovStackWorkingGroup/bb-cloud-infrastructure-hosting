## 10.1 Future Considerations

* Include a wider range of internationally recognized frameworks, e.g. European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) guidelines, GDPR for the EU, and other regional standards such as Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)
* Extend guidance on scalability taking into consideration diverse needs of nations with varying geographic and demographic contexts (e.g. geo-distributed architectures and multi-region deployments) and edge computing for improving service delivery in remote or underserved areas
* Investigate where zero trust security should be included
* Add requirements on data residency and thereby addressing the need for critical data to be stored within national borders or in compliant jurisdictions
* Highlight the importance and impact of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and multi-vendor strategies to meet stringent uptime and redundancy requirements
* Include strategies for implementing FinOps and provide guidelines on designing cost-effective, sustainable cloud infrastructures that align with global sustainability goals
