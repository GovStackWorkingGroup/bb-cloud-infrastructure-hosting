# 5 Cross-Cutting Requirements

This section will highlight important requirements or describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this Building Block.

## 5.1. Abstract <a href="#id-51-abstract" id="id-51-abstract"></a>

Digital sovereignty is essential for governments to maintain control over their IT environments and cloud technology, ensuring security, independence, and data sovereignty. This section outlines how leveraging open technology can help achieve and retain a high degree of digital sovereignty.

## 5.2. Summary <a href="#id-52-summary" id="id-52-summary"></a>

States and administrative units need to have established and followed policies for digital processes to ensure security and data protection that are resilient against pressure. We recommend to focus on these considerations to achieve digital sovereignty:

* Data Control: Having control over where data is stored and (independently) with whom it is shared. This includes metadata control.
* Infrastructure Control: Having the option to run IT infrastructure on own hardware and/or at multiple trusted (national/regional) cloud providers.
* Provider Compatibility: Ensuring the availability of more than one technologically fully compatible provider to build federated setups for resilience and scalability â€“ e.g. to be able to scale out during times of high resource needs (for example during elections). Federation capabilities make scaling across providers more manageable.
* Technological Control: Using _openly developed open source software_ to avoid all kinds of vendor lock-in and dependencies and to foster the ability to control and innovate with secure cloud technology to fulfill also advanced requirements of governments.
* Competence Building: Gaining competence in implementing and operating cloud environments (hard- and software) and in engaging in cloud-native development. Open Source projects and communities can provide the insight and transparency that help to kick start building up local competence. Experience in operating the open source software stacks needs to be built and shared.

## 5.3. The Four Dimensions of Digital Sovereignty <a href="#id-53-the-four-dimensions-of-digital-sovereignty" id="id-53-the-four-dimensions-of-digital-sovereignty"></a>

### **5.3.1. Legal dimension**

* Define and enforce rules for digital solutions, such as data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
* Consider agreements with local providers to ensure compliance with national rules.

### **5.3.2. Dimension of Choice**

* Ensure several compatible providers by using open standards to facilitate realistic choices and minimize switching costs.
* High standardization and compatibility combined with federation capabilities and secure network connections allow the use of multiple providers in parallel, ensuring resiliency.
* The technology must also be available for being deployed and run in your own data center to create your own private cloud with the same standardized capabilities that the external providers offer.

### **5.3.3. Technological Dimension**

* Avoid vendor lock-in with open source software, enabling transparency and security.
* Ensure software is maintained by active, open, diverse communities and adheres to open standards.
* Use open source cloud software that meets production-ready, secure and scalable cloud computing environments.
* Optionally create the skills to contribute to these technologies to innovate at these layers and work with the upstream communities to incorporate your innovations.

### **5.3.4. Dimension of Competence**

The best software is useless if it cannot be operated confidently. But for this to happen, skills and knowledge must be built up, fostered and retained.

* Build, foster, and retain skills and knowledge for confident operation of digital offerings.
* Create a culture where the operational knowledge is shared and people learn from each other. A blameless culture allows for engineers to also learn from mistakes.
* Contribute to the collectivization of operational knowledge through community collaboration.

### 5.4. Key Recommendations for Open Source Cloud Software <a href="#id-54-key-recommendations-for-open-source-cloud-software" id="id-54-key-recommendations-for-open-source-cloud-software"></a>

* Use mature, proven open source software maintained by active communities that are open to contributions.
* Ensure software licenses for the complete stack are open source, allowing free usage, adaptation, and contribution.
* Employ automated, integrated, interoperable, modular, and federable cloud infrastructure.
* Use standardized, modular IT architecture to reduce dependencies on vendors.
* Ensure operational knowledge is documented, readily available, and developed by an active community.
