# 4 Key Digital Functionalities

{% hint style="success" %}
The Key Digital Functionalities describe the core (required) functions that this building block must be able to perform. These functionalities should be described as business processes as opposed to technical specifications or API definitions.&#x20;

Note, this section may be extended after the key functionalities have been listed to include any assumptions or context that is needed. Additionally, if the Building Block contains multiple components, the functionalities for each may be described.

_\<Example Key Digital Functionalities (based on ID Building Block)>_

* The ID Building Block provides foundational identity services. Authentication is not provided by this Building Block
* Foundational IDs come with no specified purpose or attached entitlement but functionalities simply let an entity prove who it is
* Captures only limited information about users, such as name, date of birth, address and gender
* For a given set of credentials, fetches a corresponding ID if it exists in the registry
* Uses different biometric methods to identify and authenticate users through means other than user photographs (eg fingerprints, iris scans, facial recognition) to ensure there are no duplicates or fakes, creating a highly trustworthy database
* Used to enable services such as opening bank accounts, buying SIM cards, receiving entitlements from the government, signing forms electronically, investing in mutual funds and getting credit
* Incorporates privacy into its design when the purpose of the authentication is not revealed if a service provider sends an authentication request.
