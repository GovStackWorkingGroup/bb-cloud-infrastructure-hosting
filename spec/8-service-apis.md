# 8 Service APIs

This section describes external APIs that must be implemented by the building block. Additional APIs may be implemented by the building block (all APIs must adhere to the standards and protocols defined), but the listed APIs define a minimal set that must be provided by any implementation.

{% hint style="success" %}
All APIs will be defined using the OpenAPI (Swagger) standard. The API definitions will be hosted outside of this document. This section may provide a brief description of required APIs.&#x20;

This section will primarily contain links to the GitHub repository for OpenAPI definition (yaml) files as well as to a website hosted by GovStack that provides a live API documentation portal.

OpenAPI links to the GitHub repository can be made in an interactive way using the GitBook OpenAPI widget, linking to the GitHub repo version of the .json file, remembering to link to the “raw” url. An example from the Registries BB is shown below and can be replaced:
